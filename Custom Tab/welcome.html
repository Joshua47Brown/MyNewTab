    <h1 id="title">Welcome To Lack</h1>
    <h2 id="subtitle"><br><br> As soon as you generously clicked our download button, a small team of 
    smartly dressed robots quickly and delicately loaded your version of Lack into a lovingly sealed little box, 
    which was then sent over a relatively large waterfall down to our squirells (who wear hard hats). <br><br> Luckily, the box floats - 
    and the squirells are happy with low pay, so your extension was safely placed into our ultra-fast quantum transmitter. Finally, 
    it was beamed halfway across the world: onto your computer screen. One squirell started dancing. <br><br>Thank you for downloading.</h2>
